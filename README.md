# MQF603-Quant_Analysis

As part of the course requirement, myself and others decided to work on a simple crypto trading project that utilizes google trends data. So to simply put, we were curious to see if the frequency of specific search terms could be translated into volume of trade (i.e. if we could establish a statistically significant relationship between search terms and spikes in prices using historical data, then we could take positions accordingly).

Please refer to the report for specificities.
